If user clicks the first button ("Friend BestOf") you have to show a new screen with all Friends of the faculty (you can take the list of friends of the same faculty by calling the API **/community/get_faculty_friends**

When user click on a friend you have to start the BestOf with API.

## 4. Random Opponent BestOf
If user clicks on "Random Opponent BestOf" you have to call only API **/bestof/start_bestof** (without friend_id field) and you have to take the bestof_id that will return the API if starts successfully (otherewise you have to show an error popup).
