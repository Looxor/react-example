## There are these things to resolve:

- Coupons Shop: In the carousel there are to show only coupons that has “priority=0” and below the Carousel all Coupons that has “priority>0" (Image 1)  

  <img src="./assets/Image%201.PNG" width="300">

  **FIXED**  
  By the way, for now, there is no a field "priority" in the JSON from the server.  
  So, the carousel section will be empty now.


- If you have already used a coupon there is not to show the red error box but the coupon image (Image 2)  

  <img src="./assets/Image%202.PNG" width="300">

  **FIXED**  

- If coins cost is 0 you have to show “FREE” instead if “0 Coins” (Image 3)  

  <img src="./assets/Image%203.PNG" width="300">

  **FIXED**  

- The red error box must have a margin (like Image 4)  

  <img src="./assets/Image%204.PNG" width="300">  

  **FIXED**  

- The 16:9 image (in the Image 5) must to be without margin (width 100%)  

  <img src="./assets/Image%205.PNG" width="300">  

  **FIXED**
