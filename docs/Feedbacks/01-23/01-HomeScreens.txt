There is still the lag in the Shop screens (Shop, BestOf, Contest etc.)

This is because we have some heavy loading of data
I am going to fix problem by 
- applying caches
- by removing unnecessary codes

1. Shop
In ScontiHome, I didn't build it from the first so I need to discuss something before removing all codes there


2. BestOf
It takes a little bit long time to show the home screen. 0.5s
FIXED

3. Contest
FIXED
